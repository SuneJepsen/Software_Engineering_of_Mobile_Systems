\section{Types of mobile sensing}  
% TODO: 
% Apply definitions
% Explain difference between participatory and opportunistic sensing
% Relate to our app and articles. 
% Reflect and discuss. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Participatory sensing
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  User actively engages in the data collection activity

        \item  Manually determines how, when, what, and where to sample
   
    \end{enumerate}
            
    \item  Opportunistic sensing
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item   Data collection runs as a continuous background activity

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Application Types}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Individual activity sensing fitness applications, behavioural suggestions

        \item  Group activity sensing groups to sense common activities and help achieving group goals. Eg: assess neighbourhood safety, collective recycling efforts 
        
        \item Community sensing large scale sensing, where a large number of people have the same application installed. E.g., tracking spread of disease across a city, congestion in a city.
    \end{enumerate}

The Phone as a Sensing Device (short explanation of the different types of sensors on a mobile device)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Microphone

        \item Camera
        
        \item GPS
        \item Accelerometer
        \item Compass
        \item Gyroscope
        \item WiFi
        \item Bluetooth
        \item Proximity
        \item Light
       \item NFC (near field communication)
        \item Barometer
    \end{enumerate}




\noindent
Sensors APIs
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Google API
        \item Emotionsense (Open Source Smartphone Libraries) etc. 
    \end{enumerate}

\noindent
Cloud and Vizualization
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  BlueMix (maybe we can do a prototype which saves data in cloud)
        \item ?? What do we use to vizualize
    \end{enumerate}



\section{Inform, Share, Persuasion}
What can we learn from other sensing systems (PEIR, BeWell, ExposureSense)  and how do we ensure inform, share and persuasion for bikingbus..





\section{Location Data}
Often when working with location data one needs to calculate distances between different locations. Before elaborating this one needs to understand the different coordinate system when working with location data.  


\section{Trajectories and Preprocessing}
Lots of sensing data requires a lot of storage. In this section we present different techniques on how to compress and filter the data without loosing too much valuable data.
