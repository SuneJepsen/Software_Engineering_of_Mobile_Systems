\section{Types of mobile sensing}  
% TODO: 
% Apply definitions
% Explain difference between participatory and opportunistic sensing
% Relate to articles.
% Relate to app (start geofence -> continuous sensing -> end geofence)
% Reflect and discuss. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Participatory sensing
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  User actively engages in the data collection activity

        \item  Manually determines how, when, what, and where to sample
   
    \end{enumerate}
            
    \item  Opportunistic sensing
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item   Data collection runs as a continuous background activity

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Application Types}
% TODO: 
% Apply definitions
% Explain difference between indivudual, group and community
% Relate to articles.
% Relate to app 
%   - App is individual (now)
% Reflect and discuss. 
%   - Group could be used for sensing (location)
%     precision/accurarcy (future)
%   - Community could be to provide route data for 
%     municipality (future)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Individual activity sensing fitness applications, behavioural suggestions

        \item  Group activity sensing groups to sense common activities and help achieving group goals. Eg: assess neighbourhood safety, collective recycling efforts 
        
        \item Community sensing large scale sensing, where a large number of people have the same application installed. E.g., tracking spread of disease across a city, congestion in a city.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\section{Context Awareness}
% TODO:
% Apply definitions
% Explain context awareness, classification and phone context
% Give example of how to combine multiple sensors
%   - ex: gyroscope and accelerometer
% Relate to articles
% Relate to app: how we use classification
% Reflect and discuss. Can context awareness be used in other ways in our app?
