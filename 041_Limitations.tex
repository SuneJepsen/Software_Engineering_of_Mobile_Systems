\subsection{Limitations}

The following limitations have been identified.

Due to the nature of a semester it is limited how much time can be allocated into each aspect of a project, therefore it was a limitation to both understand the theory but also to implement it as a solution to the CykelScore case.

Many quality attribute scenarios cannot be taken into consideration for the same reasons as the previously mentioned limitation. 



% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Working in depth  with  both practice and the theory.
%     \item Many Quality Attribute Scenarios which we cant all take into account. 
% \end{itemize}
