\section{Limitations}

The following limitations have be identified.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The field of multiparty computation is broad and there exist numerous of scientific papers describing different protocols. This thesis will only focus on the main concepts in order to understand the electronic voting protocol. 
    
    \item Even though the aim is for high and reliable software quality, the application designed and developed in this thesis is to be considered proof-of-concept. 
    \item As this project involves three large objectives, we cant document every details due to time constrain. Regards to the third objective we will only document our theoretically approach and the final implementation of our electronic voting application. Leaving out documenting the agile development process that normally involves implementing the design iterative and reevaluating the design through out the process.
\end{itemize}
